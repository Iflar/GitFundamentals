# git config
    When first setting up git, you'll need to work with git config commands in order to set up your identity.

    For example, your identiy can be set up with commands such as:

    '''
    git config --global user.name Forrest Ryden

    git config --global user.email loquaciouscards@gmail.com
    '''
