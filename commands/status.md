# git status

The command 'git status' is extreamly usfull when checking on the status of the repository.

Using 'git status' will show you what changes are being tracked, aren't being tracked, what commits need to be pushed/pulled, etc.
It is exactly what it sounds like, a status check.

Status is a command that is safe to use at any time.
If you want to see what's going on it's good to use 'git status' in between commands untill you get to know the flow better.
