# git pull 

Similar to [git push](./PUSH.md), a 'git pull' will interact with a remote repository. Only this time it will **pull** the changes it does not have from the remote down to the local repository.

This means that any commits made on the remote repository will be pulled down to the local repository.

This can be done by adding the remote name and branch name:
'''
git pull origin main
'''

if there is any upstream connection established, you can use the 'git pull' specifying remote or branch.
